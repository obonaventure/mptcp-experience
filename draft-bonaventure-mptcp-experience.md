--- abstract

This document discusses both use cases and operational experience with
Multipath TCP in real world networks. It lists several prominent use
cases for which Multipath TCP has been considered and is being used.
It also gives insight to some heuristics and decisions that have
helped to realize these use cases.

Introduction
============

Multipath TCP was specified in {{RFC6824}} and five independent implementations
have been developed. As
of September 2016, Multipath TCP has been or is being implemented on
the following platforms:

 - Linux kernel {{MultipathTCP-Linux}} 
 - Apple iOS and macOS {{Apple-MPTCP}}
 - Citrix load balancers
 - FreeBSD {{FreeBSD-MPTCP}}
 - Oracle Solaris

The first three implementations are known to
interoperate. The last two are currently being tested and improved
against the Linux implementation. Three of these implementations are
open-source (Linux kernel, FreeBSD and Apple's iOS and macOS implementation).
Apple's implementation is widely deployed.

Since the publication of {{RFC6824}}, experience has been
gathered by various  network researchers and users about the
operational issues that arise when Multipath TCP is used in
today's Internet.

When the MPTCP working group was created, several use cases for
Multipath TCP were identified {{RFC6182}}. Since then, other use cases
have been proposed and some have been tested and even deployed. We
describe these use cases in  {{usecases}}.

{{operexp}} focuses on the operational
experience with Multipath TCP. Most of this experience
comes from the utilisation of the Multipath TCP implementation
in the Linux kernel {{MultipathTCP-Linux}}. This
open-source implementation has been downloaded and is used by
thousands of users all over the world. Many of these users have
provided direct or indirect feedback by writing documents (scientific
articles or blog messages) or posting to the mptcp-dev mailing list
(see   https://listes-2.sipr.ucl.ac.be/sympa/arc/mptcp-dev ).
This Multipath TCP implementation is actively maintained and
continuously improved. It is used on various types of hosts,
ranging from smartphones or embedded routers to high-end servers.

The Multipath TCP implementation in the Linux kernel is not,
by far, the most widespread deployment of Multipath
TCP. Since September 2013, Multipath TCP is also supported on
smartphones and tablets since iOS7 {{IOS7}}. There are likely
hundreds of millions of Multipath TCP enabled devices. However,
this particular Multipath TCP implementation is currently only
used to support the Siri voice recognition/control 
application. Unfortunately, there is no public information 
about the lessons learned from this large scale deployment.

{{operexp}} is organized as follows.
Supporting the middleboxes was one of the difficult issues in
designing the Multipath TCP protocol. We explain in  {{mbox}}
which types of middleboxes the Linux Kernel implementation of
Multipath TCP supports and how it reacts upon encountering
these.  {{congestion}} summarises the MPTCP specific
congestion controls that have been implemented.  {{pm}} to
{{scheduler}} discuss heuristics and issues with respect to subflow
management as well as the scheduling across the subflows. 
{{mss}} explains some problems that occurred with subflows having
different Maximum Segment Size (MSS) values.  {{cdn}} presents issues with respect
to content delivery networks and suggests a solution to this issue.
Finally,  {{wifi}} documents an issue with captive portals
where MPTCP  will behave suboptimally.

Use cases {#usecases}
=========

Multipath TCP has been tested in several use cases. There is already
an abundant scientific literature on Multipath TCP {{MPTCPBIB}}.
Several of the papers published in the scientific literature have
identified possible improvements that are worth being discussed here.

Datacenters {#dc}
-----------

A first, although initially unexpected, documented use case for
Multipath TCP has been in datacenters
{{HotNets}}{{SIGCOMM11}}. Today's datacenters are designed to provide
several paths between single-homed servers. The multiplicity of these
paths comes from the utilization of Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) and
other load balancing techniques inside the datacenter. Most of the
deployed load balancing techniques in datacenters rely on hashes
computed over the five tuple. Thus all packets from the same TCP
connection follow the same path and so are not reordered.
The results in {{HotNets}} demonstrate by
simulations that Multipath TCP can achieve a better utilization of the
available network by using multiple subflows for each Multipath TCP
session. Although {{RFC6182}} assumes that at least one of the
communicating hosts has several IP addresses, {{HotNets}} demonstrates
that Multipath TCP is beneficial when both hosts are single-homed. This
idea is analysed in more details in {{SIGCOMM11}} where  the Multipath TCP
implementation in the Linux kernel is modified to be able to use
several subflows from the same IP address. Measurements in a public
datacenter show the quantitative benefits of Multipath TCP
{{SIGCOMM11}} in this environment. 

Although ECMP is widely used inside datacenters, this is not the only
environment where there are different paths between a pair of hosts.
ECMP and other load balancing techniques such as Link Aggregation
Groups (LAG) are widely used
in today's networks and having multiple paths between a pair of
single-homed hosts is becoming the norm instead of the exception.
Although these multiple paths have often the same cost (from an IGP
metrics viewpoint), they do not necessarily have the same performance.
For example, {{IMC13c}} reports the results of a long measurement
study showing that load balanced Internet paths between that same pair
of hosts can have huge delay differences.

Cellular/WiFi Offload {#smartphones}
---------------------

A second use case that has been explored by several network
researchers is the cellular/WiFi offload use case. Smartphones or
other mobile devices equipped with two wireless interfaces are a very
common use case for Multipath TCP. In September 2015, this is also
the largest deployment of Multipath-TCP enabled devices {{IOS7}}.
It has been briefly discussed during IETF88 {{ietf88}}, but there is
no published paper or report that analyses this deployment.
For this reason, we only discuss published papers that have mainly
used the Multipath TCP implementation in the Linux kernel for
their experiments.

The performance of Multipath TCP in wireless networks was briefly
evaluated in {{NSDI12}}. One experiment analyzes the performance of
Multipath TCP on a client with two wireless interfaces. This
evaluation shows that when the receive window is large, Multipath TCP
can efficiently use the two available links. However, if the window
becomes smaller, then packets sent on a slow path can block the
transmission of packets on a faster path. In some cases, the
performance of Multipath TCP over two paths can become lower than the
performance of regular TCP over the best performing path. Two
heuristics, reinjection and penalization, are proposed in {{NSDI12}}
to solve this identified performance problem. These two heuristics
have since been used in the Multipath TCP implementation in the Linux
kernel. {{CONEXT13}} explored the problem in more detail and revealed
some other scenarios where Multipath TCP can have difficulties in
efficiently pooling the available paths. Improvements to the Multipath
TCP implementation in the Linux kernel are proposed in {{CONEXT13}}
to cope with some of these problems.

The first experimental analysis of Multipath TCP in a public wireless
environment was presented in {{Cellnet12}}. These measurements explore
the ability of Multipath TCP to use two wireless networks (real WiFi
and 3G networks). Three modes of operation are compared. The first
mode of operation is the simultaneous use of the two wireless
networks. In this mode, Multipath TCP pools the available resources
and uses both wireless interfaces. This mode provides fast handover
from WiFi to cellular or the opposite when the user
moves. Measurements presented in {{CACM14}} show that the handover
from one wireless network to another is not an abrupt process. When
a host moves, there are regions where the quality
of one of the  wireless networks is weaker than the other, but the
host considers this wireless network to still be up. When a mobile
host enters such regions, its ability to send packets over another
wireless network is important to ensure a smooth handover. This is
clearly illustrated from the packet trace discussed in {{CACM14}}.

Many cellular networks use volume-based pricing and users often prefer
to use unmetered WiFi networks when available instead of metered
cellular networks. {{Cellnet12}} implements support for the
MP\_PRIO option to explore two other modes of operation. 

In the backup mode, Multipath TCP opens a TCP subflow over each
interface, but the cellular interface is configured in backup mode.
This implies that data flows only over the WiFi interface when both
interfaces are considered to be active. If the WiFi interface fails,
then the traffic switches quickly to the cellular interface, ensuring
a smooth handover from the user's viewpoint {{Cellnet12}}. The cost of
this approach is that the WiFi and cellular interfaces are likely to
remain active all the time since all subflows are established over
the two interfaces.

The single-path mode is slightly different. This mode benefits from
the break-before-make capability of Multipath TCP. When an MPTCP
session is established, a subflow is created over the WiFi interface.
No packet is sent over the cellular interface as long as the WiFi
interface remains up {{Cellnet12}}. This implies that the cellular
interface can remain idle and battery capacity is preserved. When the
WiFi interface fails, a new subflow is established over the cellular
interface in order to preserve the established Multipath TCP sessions.
Compared to the backup mode described earlier, measurements
reported in {{Cellnet12}} indicate that this mode of operation
is characterised by a throughput drop while the cellular interface is
brought up and the subflows are reestablished. 

From a protocol viewpoint, {{Cellnet12}} discusses the problem posed
by the unreliability of the REMOVE\_ADDR option and proposes a small
protocol extension to allow hosts to reliably exchange this
option. It would be useful to analyze packet traces to understand
whether the unreliability of the REMOVE\_ADDR option poses an
operational problem in real deployments.

Another study of the performance of Multipath TCP in wireless networks
was reported  in {{IMC13b}}. This study uses laptops connected to
various cellular ISPs and WiFi hotspots. It compares various file
transfer scenarios. {{IMC13b}} observes that 4-path MPTCP
outperforms 2-path MPTCP, especially for larger files.
However, for three congestion control algorithms (LIA, OLIA and Reno - see {{congestion}}),
there is no significant performance difference for file sizes smaller than 4MB.

A different study of the performance of Multipath TCP with two
wireless networks is presented in {{INFOCOM14}}. In this study the
two networks had different qualities : a good network and a lossy
network. When using two paths with different packet loss ratios, the
Multipath TCP congestion control scheme moves traffic away from the
lossy link that is considered to be congested. However, {{INFOCOM14}}
documents an interesting scenario that is summarised hereafter.


~~~~~~~~~~

client ----------- path1 -------- server
  |                                  |
  +--------------- path2 ------------+

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #figsimple title="Simple network topology"}

Initially, the two paths in {{figsimple}} have the same quality and Multipath TCP
distributes the load over both of them. During the transfer, the
second path becomes lossy, e.g. because the client moves. Multipath
TCP detects the packet losses and they are retransmitted over the
first path. This enables the data transfer to continue over the first
path. However, the subflow over the second path is still up and
transmits one packet from time to time. Although the N packets have
been acknowledged over the first subflow (at the MPTCP level), they
have not been acknowledged at the TCP level over the second
subflow. To preserve the continuity of the sequence numbers over the
second subflow, TCP will continue to retransmit these segments until
either they are acknowledged or the maximum number of retransmissions
is reached. This behavior is clearly inefficient and may lead to
blocking since the second subflow will consume window space to be able
to retransmit these packets. {{INFOCOM14}} proposes a new Multipath
TCP option to solve this problem. In practice, a new TCP option is
probably not required. When the client detects that the data
transmitted over the second subflow has been acknowledged over the
first subflow, it could decide to terminate the second subflow by
sending a RST segment. If the interface associated to this subflow is
still up, a new subflow could be immediately reestablished. It would
then be immediately usable to send new data and would not be forced
to first retransmit the previously transmitted data. As of this
writing, this dynamic management of the subflows is not yet
implemented in the Multipath TCP implementation in the Linux kernel.

Some studies have started to analyse the performance of Multipath TCP on
smartphones with real applications. In contrast with the bulk transfers
that are used by many publications, many real applications do not exchange huge amounts
of data and establish a large number of small connections. {{COMMAG2016}}
proposes a software testing framework that allows to automate Android 
applications to study their interactions with Multipath TCP. 
{{PAM2016}} analyses a one-month packet trace of all the packets exchanged
by a dozen of smartphones used by regular users. This analysis reveals 
that short connections are important on smartphones and that the main
benefit of using Multipath TCP on smartphones is the ability to perform
seamless handovers between different wireless networks. Long connections
benefit from these handovers.


Multipath TCP proxies {#proxy}
---------------------

As Multipath TCP is not yet widely deployed on both clients and servers,
several deployments have used various forms of proxies. Two families
of solutions are currently being used or tested. 

A first use case is when a Multipath TCP enabled client wants to use
several interfaces to reach a regular TCP server. A typical use case
is a smartphone that needs to use both its WiFi and its cellular 
interface to transfer data. Several types of proxies are possible
for this use case. An HTTP proxy deployed on a Multipath TCP capable
server would enable the smartphone to use Multipath TCP to access
regular web servers. Obviously, this solution only works for applications
that rely on HTTP. Another possibility is to use a proxy that can
convert any Multipath TCP connection into a regular TCP connection.
Multipath TCP-specific proxies have been proposed 
{{HotMiddlebox13b}} {{HAMPEL}}. 

Another possibility leverages the SOCKS protocol {{RFC1928}}. SOCKS
is often used in enterprise networks to allow clients to reach
external servers. For this, the client opens a TCP connection to the
SOCKS server that relays it to the final destination. If both the client
and the SOCKS server use Multipath TCP, but not the final destination,
then Multipath TCP can still be used on the path between the client
and the SOCKS server. At IETF'93, Korea Telecom announced that they
have deployed in June 2015 a commercial service that uses Multipath
TCP on smartphones. These smartphones access regular TCP servers
through a SOCKS proxy. This enables them to achieve throughputs of up
to 850 Mbps {{KT}}. 

Measurements performed with Android smartphones {{Mobicom15}} show that
popular applications work correctly through a SOCKS
proxy and Multipath TCP enabled smartphones. 
Thanks to Multipath TCP, long-lived connections can be spread over the two
available interfaces. However, for short-lived connections, most of the data
is sent over the initial subflow that is created over the interface
corresponding to the default route and the second subflow is almost
not used {{PAM2016}}.

A second use case is when Multipath TCP is used by middleboxes, typically
inside access networks. Various network operators are discussing and
evaluating solutions for hybrid access networks {{BBF-WT348}}. 
Such networks arise
when a network operator controls two different access network
technologies, e.g. wired and cellular, and wants to combine them to improve the bandwidth
offered to the endusers {{I-D.lhwxz-hybrid-access-network-architecture}}.
Several solutions are currently investigated for such networks
{{BBF-WT348}}.
{{fighybrid}} shows the organisation of such a network. When a client
creates a normal TCP connection, it is intercepted by the Hybrid CPE 
(HPCE) that converts it in a Multipath TCP connection so that it
can use the available access networks (DSL and LTE in the example).
The Hybrid Access Gateway (HAG) does the opposite to ensure that the
regular server sees a normal TCP connection. Some of the solutions
that are currently discussed for hybrid networks use
Multipath TCP on the HCPE and the HAG. Other solutions rely on
tunnels between the HCPE and the
HAG {{I-D.lhwxz-gre-notifications-hybrid-access}}.

Operational Experience {#operexp}
======================


Middlebox interference {#mbox}
----------------------

The interference caused by various types of middleboxes has been
an important concern during the design of the Multipath TCP protocol.
Three studies on the interactions between Multipath TCP and
middleboxes are worth discussing.

The first analysis appears in {{IMC11}}. This paper was the main
motivation for Multipath TCP incorporating various techniques to
cope with middlebox interference. More specifically, Multipath TCP
has been designed to cope with middleboxes that :

 - change source or destination addresses
 - change source or destination port numbers
 - change TCP sequence numbers
 - split or coalesce segments
 - remove TCP options
 - modify the payload of TCP segments 

These middlebox interferences have all been included in the MBtest
suite {{MBTest}}. This test suite is used in {{HotMiddlebox13}}
to verify the reaction of the Multipath TCP implementation in the
Linux kernel {{MultipathTCP-Linux}} when faced with middlebox
interference.  The test
environment used for this evaluation is a dual-homed client connected
to a single-homed server. The middlebox behavior can be activated on
any of the paths. The main results of this analysis are :

 - the version 0.87 of the Multipath TCP implementation in the Linux kernel, is not
affected by a middlebox that performs NAT or modifies TCP sequence numbers
 - when a middlebox removes the MP_CAPABLE option from the initial
SYN segment, the v0.87 Multipath TCP implementation in the Linux kernel
falls back correctly to regular TCP
 - when a middlebox removes the DSS option from all data segments, the
v0.87 Multipath TCP implementation in the Linux kernel falls back correctly
to regular TCP
 - when a middlebox performs segment coalescing, the v0.87 Multipath TCP
implementation in the Linux kernel is still able to accurately extract
the data corresponding to the indicated mapping
 - when a middlebox performs segment splitting, the v0.87 Multipath TCP
implementation in the Linux kernel correctly reassembles the data
corresponding to the indicated mapping. {{HotMiddlebox13}} shows on
figure 4 in section 3.3
a corner case with segment splitting that may lead to a
desynchronisation between the two hosts.

The interactions between Multipath TCP and real deployed middleboxes
is also analyzed in {{HotMiddlebox13}} and a particular scenario with
the FTP application level gateway running on a NAT is described.

Middlebox interference can also be detected by analysing packet
traces on Multipath TCP enabled servers. 
A closer look at the packets received on the multipath-tcp.org server 
{{TMA2015}} shows that among the 184,000 Multipath TCP connections, 
only 125 of them were falling back to regular TCP. These connections
originated from 28 different client IP addresses. These include 91 HTTP 
connections and 34 FTP connections. The FTP interference is expected 
and due to Application Level Gateways running in home routers. The HTTP 
interference appeared only on the direction from server to client and 
could have been caused by transparent proxies deployed in cellular 
or enterprise networks. A longer trace is discussed in {{COMCOM2016}} and
similar conclusions about the middlebox interference are provided.

From an operational viewpoint, knowing that Multipath TCP can cope
with various types of middlebox interference is important. However,
there are situations where the network operators need to gather
information about where a particular middlebox interference
occurs. The tracebox software {{tracebox}} described in {{IMC13a}} is
an extension of the popular traceroute software that enables network
operators to check at which hop a particular field of the TCP header
(including options) is modified. It has been used by several network
operators to debug various middlebox interference problems.
Experience with tracebox indicates that supporting the ICMP
extension defined in {{RFC1812}} makes it easier to debug
middlebox problems in IPv4 networks. 

Users of the Multipath TCP implementation have reported some
experience with middlebox interference. The strangest scenario has
been a middlebox that accepts the Multipath TCP options in the SYN
segment but later replaces Multipath TCP options with a TCP EOL
option {{StrangeMbox}}. This causes Multipath TCP to perform a
fallback to regular TCP without any impact on the application.

Congestion control {#congestion}
------------------

Congestion control has been an important challenge for Multipath
TCP. The standardised congestion control scheme for Multipath TCP is
defined in {{RFC6356}}. A detailed description of this
algorithm is provided in {{NSDI11}}. This congestion control scheme
has been implemented in the Linux implementation of Multipath
TCP. Linux uses a modular architecture to support various congestion
control schemes. This architecture is applicable for both regular TCP
and Multipath TCP. While the coupled congestion control scheme defined
in {{RFC6356}} is the default congestion control scheme in the Linux
implementation, other congestion control schemes have been added. The
second congestion control scheme is OLIA {{CONEXT12}}. This congestion
control scheme is also an adaptation of the NewReno single path
congestion control scheme to support multiple paths. Simulations and
measurements have shown that it provides some performance benefits
compared to the default congestion control scheme
{{CONEXT12}}. Measurements over a wide range of parameters reported in
{{CONEXT13}} also indicate some benefits with the OLIA congestion
control scheme. Recently, a delay-based congestion control scheme has
been ported to the Multipath TCP implementation in the Linux
kernel. This congestion control scheme has been evaluated by using
simulations in {{ICNP12}}. The fourth congestion control scheme that
has been included in the Linux implementation of Multipath TCP
is the BALIA scheme that provides a better balance
between TCP friendliness, responsiveness, and window oscillation {{BALIA}}.

These different congestion control schemes have been compared in
several articles. {{CONEXT13}} and {{PaaschPhD}} compare these algorithms in an emulated
environment. The evaluation showed that the delay-based congestion
control scheme is less able to efficiently use the available links
than the three other schemes.
 

Subflow management {#pm}
------------------

The multipath capability of Multipath TCP comes from the utilisation
of one subflow per path. The Multipath TCP architecture {{RFC6182}}
and the protocol specification {{RFC6824}} define the basic usage of
the subflows and the protocol mechanisms that are required to create
and terminate them. However, there are no guidelines on how subflows
are used during the lifetime of a Multipath TCP session. Most of the
published experiments with Multipath TCP have been performed in controlled
environments. Still, based on the experience running them and
discussions on the mptcp-dev mailing list, interesting lessons have
been learned about the management of these subflows.


From a subflow viewpoint, the Multipath TCP protocol is completely
symmetrical. Both the clients and the server have the capability 
to create subflows. However in practice the existing Multipath TCP
implementations have
opted for a strategy where only the client creates new subflows. 
The main motivation for this strategy is that often the client 
resides behind a NAT or a firewall, preventing passive subflow 
openings on the client. Although there are environments such as 
datacenters where this problem does not occur, as of this writing,
no precise requirement has emerged for allowing the server to 
create new subflows.

Implemented subflow managers 
----------------------------

The Multipath TCP implementation in the Linux kernel includes 
several strategies to manage the subflows that compose a Multipath
TCP session. The basic subflow manager is the full-mesh. As the 
name implies, it creates a full-mesh of subflows between the 
communicating hosts.

The most frequent use case for this subflow manager is a multihomed
client connected to a single-homed server. In this case, one subflow
is created for each interface on the client. The current 
implementation of the full-mesh subflow manager is static. The subflows
are created immediately after the creation of the initial subflow. If 
one subflow fails during the lifetime of the Multipath TCP session 
(e.g. due to excessive retransmissions, or the loss of the 
corresponding interface), it is not always reestablished. There is 
ongoing work to enhance the full-mesh path manager to deal with 
such events.

When the server is multihomed, using the full-mesh subflow manager 
may lead to a large number of subflows being established. For example, 
consider a dual-homed client connected to a server with three 
interfaces. In this case, even if the subflows are only created by 
the client, 6 subflows will be established. This may be excessive 
in some environments, in particular when the client and/or the server 
have a large number of interfaces. A recent draft has proposed
a Multipath TCP option to negotiate the maximum number
of subflows. 
However, it should be noted that there have been reports on the 
mptcp-dev mailing indicating that users rely on Multipath TCP to 
aggregate more than four different interfaces. Thus, there is a 
need for supporting many interfaces efficiently.

Creating subflows between multihomed clients and servers may 
sometimes lead to operational issues as observed by discussions 
on the mptcp-dev mailing list. In some cases the network operators
would like to have a better control on how the subflows are 
created by Multipath TCP {{I-D.boucadair-mptcp-max-subflow}}. 
This might require the definition of policy rules to control 
the operation of the subflow manager. The two scenarios below 
illustrate some of these requirements.

~~~~~~~~~~

        host1 ----------  switch1 ----- host2
          |                   |            |
          +--------------  switch2 --------+

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #figswitched title="Simple switched network topology"}


Consider the simple network topology shown in {{figswitched}}. 
From an operational viewpoint, a network operator could want to 
create two subflows between the communicating hosts. From a bandwidth
utilization viewpoint, the most natural paths are host1-switch1-host2 
and host1-switch2-host2. However, a Multipath TCP implementation 
running on these two hosts may sometimes have difficulties to 
obtain this result.


To understand the difficulty, let us consider different allocation
strategies for the IP addresses. A first strategy is to assign two
subnets : subnetA (resp. subnetB) contains the IP addresses of 
host1's interface to switch1 (resp. switch2) and host2's interface
to switch1 (resp. switch2). In this case, a Multipath TCP subflow
manager should only create one subflow per subnet. To enforce the 
utilization of these paths, the network operator would have to 
specify a policy that prefers the subflows in the same subnet over 
subflows between addresses in different subnets. It should be noted
that the policy should probably also specify how the subflow manager
should react when an interface or subflow fails.

A second strategy is to use a single subnet for all IP addresses. 
In this case, it becomes more difficult to specify a policy that 
indicates which subflows should be established. 


The second subflow manager that is currently supported by the 
Multipath TCP implementation in the Linux kernel is the ndiffport 
subflow manager. This manager was initially created to exploit 
the path diversity that exists between single-homed hosts due to 
the utilization of flow-based load balancing techniques {{SIGCOMM11}}.
This subflow manager creates N subflows between the same pair of IP 
addresses. The N subflows are created by the client and differ 
only in the source port selected by the client. It was not
designed to be used on multihomed hosts.

A more flexible subflow manager has been proposed, implemented
and evaluated in {{CONEXT15}}. This subflow manager exposes various
kernel events to a user space daemon that decides when subflows
need to be created and terminated based on various policies.


Subflow destination port
------------------------

The Multipath TCP protocol relies on the token contained in the 
MP\_JOIN option to associate a subflow to an existing Multipath
TCP session. This implies that there is no restriction on the
source address, destination address and source or destination
ports used for the new subflow. The ability to use different
source and destination addresses is key to support multihomed
servers and clients. The ability to use different destination
port numbers is worth discussing because it has operational
implications.


For illustration, consider a dual-homed client that creates a
second subflow to reach a single-homed server as illustrated in
{{figmultihomed}}.

~~~~~~~~~~

        client ------- r1 --- internet --- server
            |                   |
            +----------r2-------+

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #figmultihomed title="Multihomed-client connected to single-homed server"}


When the Multipath TCP implementation in the Linux kernel creates
the second subflow it uses the same destination port as the initial
subflow. This choice is motivated by the fact that the server might
be protected by a firewall and only accept TCP connections
(including subflows) on the official port number. Using the same
destination port for all subflows is also useful for operators
that rely on the port numbers to track application usage in their
network. 


There have been suggestions from Multipath TCP users to modify the
implementation to allow the client to use different destination
ports to reach the server. This suggestion seems mainly motivated
by traffic shaping middleboxes that are used in some wireless
networks. In networks where different shaping rates are associated
to different destination port numbers, this could allow Multipath
TCP to reach a higher performance. This behaviour valid according
to the Multipath TCP specificiation {{RFC6824}}. The proposed
APIs for Multipath TCP could enable application developers to
perform such twekaing. 

However, from an implementation point-of-view supporting different
destination ports for the same Multipath TCP connection can cause
some issues. A legacy implementation of a TCP stack
creates a listening socket to react upon incoming SYN segments.
The listening socket is handling the SYN segments that are sent
on a specific port number. Demultiplexing incoming segments can
thus be done solely by looking at the IP addresses and the port
numbers. With Multipath TCP however, incoming SYN segments may
have an MP\_JOIN option with a different destination port. This
means, that all incoming segments that did not match on an existing
listening-socket or an already established socket must be parsed
for an eventual MP\_JOIN option. This imposes an additional cost
on servers, previously not existent on legacy TCP implementations.

Closing subflows

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #figtimewait title="Multipath TCP may not be able to avoid time-wait state on the subflow (indicated as Sub in the drawing), even if enforced by the application on the client-side."}


{{figtimewait}} shows a very particular issue within Multipath TCP.
Many high-performance applications try to avoid Time-Wait state by
deferring the closure of the connection until the peer has sent a
FIN. That way, the client on the left of {{figtimewait}} does a
passive closure of the connection, transitioning from Close-Wait
to Last-ACK and finally freeing the resources after reception of the
ACK of the FIN. An application running on top of a Multipath TCP
enabled Linux kernel might also use this approach. The difference
here is that the close() of the connection (Step 1 in {{figtimewait}})
only triggers the sending of a DATA\_FIN. Nothing guarantees that the
kernel is ready to combine the DATA\_FIN with a subflow-FIN. The
reception of the DATA\_FIN will make the application trigger the
closure of the connection (step 2), trying to avoid Time-Wait state
with this late closure. This time, the kernel might decide to combine
the DATA_FIN with a subflow-FIN. This decision will be fatal, as the
subflow's state machine will not transition from Close-Wait to
Last-Ack, but rather go through Fin-Wait-2 into Time-Wait state.
The Time-Wait state will consume resources on the host for at least
2 MSL (Maximum Segment Lifetime). Thus, a smart application that
tries to avoid Time-Wait state by doing late closure of the
connection actually ends up with one of its subflows in Time-Wait
state. A high-performance Multipath TCP kernel implementation should
honor the desire of the application to do passive closure of the
connection and successfully avoid Time-Wait state - even on the
subflows.

The solution to this problem lies in an optimistic assumption that
a host doing active-closure of a Multipath TCP connection by sending
a DATA\_FIN will soon also send a FIN on all its subflows. Thus,
the passive closer of the connection can simply wait for the peer to
send exactly this FIN - enforcing passive closure even on the
subflows. Of course, to avoid consuming resources indefinitely,
a timer must limit the time our implementation waits for the FIN.


Packet schedulers {#scheduler}
-------------------------

In a Multipath TCP implementation, the packet scheduler is the
algorithm that is executed when transmitting each packet to decide
on which subflow it needs to be transmitted. The packet scheduler
itself does not have any impact on the interoperability of Multipath
TCP implementations. However, it may clearly impact the performance
of Multipath TCP sessions. The Multipath TCP implementation in the
Linux kernel supports a pluggable architecture for the packet
scheduler {{PaaschPhD}}. As of this writing, two schedulers have
been implemented: round-robin and lowest-rtt-first. The second
scheduler relies on the round-trip-time (rtt) measured on each TCP
subflow and sends first segments over the subflow having the lowest round-trip-time.
They are compared
in {{CSWS14}}. The experiments and measurements described in
{{CSWS14}} show that the lowest-rtt-first scheduler appears to
be the best compromise from a performance viewpoint.
Another study of the packet schedulers is presented in {{PAMS2014}}.
This study relies on simulations with the Multipath TCP implementation
in the Linux kernel. They compare the lowest-rtt-first with the
round-robin and a random scheduler. They show some situations
where the lowest-rtt-first scheduler does not perform as well as
the other schedulers, but there are many scenarios where the
opposite is true. {{PAMS2014}} notes that "it is highly likely that
the optimal scheduling strategy depends on the characteristics of the
paths being used."

Segment size selection {#mss}
------------------------

When an application performs a write/send system call, the kernel 
allocates a packet buffer (sk_buff in Linux) to store the data the 
application wants to send. The kernel will store at most one MSS 
(Maximum Segment Size) of data per buffer. As the MSS can differ amongst 
subflows, an MPTCP implementation must select carefully the MSS used 
to generate application data. The Linux kernel implementation 
had various ways of selecting the MSS: minimum or maximum amongst the 
different subflows. However, these heuristics of MSS selection can
cause significant performance issues in some environment. Consider the following 
example. An MPTCP connection has two established subflows that 
respectively use a MSS of 1420 and 1428 bytes. If MPTCP selects
the maximum,
then the application will generate segments of 1428 bytes of data. An 
MPTCP implementation will have to split the segment in two (a 
1420-byte and 8-byte segments) when pushing on the subflow with the 
smallest MSS. The latter segment will introduce a large overhead as 
for a single data segment 2 slots will be used in the congestion 
window (in packets) therefore reducing by roughly twice the potential throughput 
(in bytes/s) of this subflow. Taking the smallest MSS does not solve 
the issue as there might be a case where the subflow with the smallest 
MSS only sends a few packets
therefore reducing the potential throughput of the other subflows. 

The Linux implementation recently took another approach {{DetalMSS}}.
Instead of 
selecting the minimum and maximum values, it now dynamically adapts 
the MSS based on the contribution of all the subflows to the 
connection's throughput. For this it computes, for each subflow,
the potential 
throughput achieved by selecting each MSS value and by taking into 
account the lost space in the cwnd. It then selects the MSS that
allows to achieve the highest potential throughput. 



Interactions with the Domain Name System {#cdn}
---------------------------------------

Multihomed clients such as smartphones can send DNS
queries over any of their interfaces. When a
single-homed client performs a DNS query, it receives from its local
resolver the best answer for its request. If the client is
multihomed, the answer in response to the DNS query may vary with
the interface over which it has been sent.

~~~~~~~~~~

                   cdn1
                    |
        client -- cellular -- internet -- cdn3
           |                   |
           +----- wifi --------+
                    |
                  cdn2

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #figcdn title="Simple network topology"}


If the client sends a DNS query over the WiFi interface, the answer
will point to the cdn2 server while the same request sent over the
cellular interface will point to the cdn1 server. This might cause
problems for CDN providers that locate their servers inside ISP
networks and have contracts that specify that the CDN server will only
be accessed from within this particular ISP. Assume now that both the
client and the CDN servers support Multipath TCP. In this case, a
Multipath TCP session from cdn1 or cdn2 would potentially use both
the cellular network and the WiFi network. Serving the client from
cdn2 over the cellular interface could violate the
contract between the CDN provider and the network operators. A similar
problem occurs with regular TCP if the client caches DNS replies. For
example the client obtains a DNS answer over the cellular interface
and then stops this interface and starts to use its WiFi interface. If
the client retrieves data from cdn1 over its WiFi interface, this may
also violate the contract between the CDN and the network operators.

A possible solution to prevent this problem would be to modify the
DNS resolution on the client. The client subnet EDNS extension
defined in {{RFC7871}} could be used
for this purpose. When the client sends a DNS query from its WiFi
interface, it should also send the client subnet corresponding to
the cellular interface in this request. This would indicate to the
resolver that the answer should be valid for both the WiFi and the
cellular interfaces (e.g., the cdn3 server).


Captive portals {#wifi}
------------

Multipath TCP enables a host to use different interfaces to reach
a server. In theory, this should ensure connectivity when at least
one of the interfaces is active. In practice however, there are
some particular scenarios with captive portals that may cause
operational problems. The reference environment is
shown in {{figcaptive}}.


~~~~~~~~~~

        client -----  network1
             |
             +------- internet ------------- server

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #figcaptive title="Issue with captive portal"}


The client is attached to two networks : network1 that provides
limited connectivity and the entire Internet through the second
network interface. In practice, this scenario corresponds to an open
WiFi network with a captive portal for network1 and a cellular service
for the second interface. On many smartphones, the WiFi interface is
preferred over the cellular interface. If the smartphone learns a
default route via both interfaces, it will typically prefer to use the
WiFi interface to send its DNS request and create the first subflow.
This is not optimal with Multipath TCP. A better approach would
probably be to try a few attempts on the WiFi interface and then, upon failure of these attempts,
try to use the second interface for the initial subflow as well.


Stateless webservers {#syncookies}
--------------------

MPTCP has been designed to interoperate with webservers that benefit from SYN-cookies
to protect against SYN-flooding attacks {{RFC4987}}. MPTCP achieves this by
echoing the keys negotiated during the MP_CAPABLE handshake in the third ACK of the 3-way handshake.
Reception of this third ACK then allows the server to reconstruct the state
specific to MPTCP.

However, one caveat to this mechanism is the non-reliable nature of the third ACK.
Indeed, when the third ACK gets lost, the server will not be able to reconstruct
the MPTCP-state. MPTCP will fallback to regular TCP in this case.
This is in contrast to regular TCP. When the client starts sending data, the first
data segment also includes the SYN-cookie, which allows the server to reconstruct
the TCP-state. Further, this data segment will be retransmitted by the client
in case it gets lost and thus is resilient against loss. MPTCP does not include
the keys in this data segment and thus the server cannot reconstruct the MPTCP state.

This issue might be considered as a minor one for MPTCP. Losing the third ACK
should only happen when packet loss is high. However, when packet-loss
is high MPTCP provides a lot of benefits as it can move traffic away from the
lossy link. It is undesirable that MPTCP has a higher chance to fall back to
regular TCP in those lossy environments.

{{I-D.paasch-mptcp-syncookies}} discusses this issue and suggests a modified
handshake mechanism that ensures reliable delivery of the MP_CAPABLE, following
the 3-way handshake. This modification will make MPTCP reliable, even in lossy
environments when servers need to use SYN-cookies to protect against SYN-flooding attacks.


Loadbalanced serverfarms {#loadbalancer}
------------------------

Large-scale serverfarms typically deploy thousands of servers behind a single
virtual IP (VIP). Steering traffic to these servers is done through layer-4 loadbalancers
that ensure that a TCP-flow will always be routed to the same server {{Presto08}}.

As Multipath TCP uses multiple different TCP subflows to steer the traffic across
the different paths, loadbalancers need to ensure that all these subflows are
routed to the same server. This implies that the loadbalancers need to track
the MPTCP-related state, allowing them to parse the token in the MP_JOIN and assign
those subflows to the appropriate server. However, serverfarms typically deploy
multiple of these loadbalancers for reliability and capacity reasons. As a
TCP subflow might get routed to any of these loadbalancers, they
would need to synchronize the MPTCP-related state - a solution that is not feasible
at large scale.

The token (carried in the MP_JOIN) contains the information indicating which
MPTCP-session the subflow belongs to. As the token is a hash of the key, servers
are not able to generate the token in such a way that the token can provide the
necessary information to the loadbalancers which would allow them to
route TCP subflows to the appropriate server. {{I-D.paasch-mptcp-loadbalancer}}
discusses this issue in detail and suggests two alternative MP_CAPABLE handshakes
to overcome these. As of September 2015, it is not yet clear how MPTCP might accommodate
such use-case to enable its deployment within loadbalanced serverfarms.

Security Considerations
=======================

This informational document discusses use-cases and operational experience with
Multipath TCP. An extensive analysis of the remaining security issues in the
Multipath TCP specification has been published in {{RFC7430}}, together with
suggestions for possible solutions.

From a security viewpoint, it is important to note that Multipath TCP, like 
other multipath solutions such as SCTP, has the ability to send packets
belonging to a single connection over different paths. This design feature
of Multipath TCP implies that middleboxes that have been deployed on-path
assuming that they would observe all the packets exchanged for a given
connection in both directions may not function correctly anymore. A typical
example are firewalls, IDS or DPIs deployed in enterprise networks. Those
devices expect to observe all the packets from all TCP connections.
With Multipath TCP, those middleboxes
may not observe anymore all packets since some of them may follow a
different path. The two examples below illustrate typical deployments of
such middleboxes. The first example, {{figphonembox}}, shows a Multipath TCP
enabled smartphone attached to both an enterprise and a cellular
network. If a Multipath TCP connection is established by the smartphone
towards a server, some of the packets sent by the smartphone or the
server may be transmitted over the cellular network and thus be
invisible for the enterprise middlebox. 

~~~~~~~~~~

  smartphone +----- entreprise net --- MBox----+------ server
             |                                 |
             +----- cellular net  -------------+ 

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #figphonembox title="Enteprise Middlebox may not observe all packets from multihomed host"}

The second example, {{figcsmbox}}, shows a possible issue when multiple middleboxes
are deployed inside a network. For simplicity, we assume that network1 is the default
IPv4 path while network2 is the default IPv6 path. A similar issue could occur with
per-flow load balancing such as ECMP {{RFC2992}}. With regular TCP, all packets from
each connection would either pass through Mbox1 or Mbox2. With Multipath TCP, the client
can easily establish a subflow over network1 and another over network2 and each middlebox
would only observe a part of the traffic of the end-to-end Multipath TCP connection.

~~~~~~~~~~

  client ----R-- network1  --- MBox1 -----R------------- server
             |                            |
             +-- network2  --- MBox2 -----+

~~~~~~~~~~
{: #figcsmbox title="Interactions between load balancing and security Middleboxes"}


In these two cases, it is possible for an attacker to evade some security measures
operating on the TCP bytestream and implemented on the middleboxes by controlling 
the bytes that are actually sent over each subflow and there are tools that ease
those kinds of evasion {{PZ15}} {{PT14}}. This is not a security issue for Multipath TCP itself
since Multipath TCP behaves correctly. However, this demonstrates the difficulty of
enforcing security policies by relying only on on-path middleboxes instead of enforcing
them directly on the endpoints.
